# Digit Recognition System
This program uses the Neural network machine learning concept and PyTorch Library to identify the digit in the image. The program does two major things:  
Training: It trains the neural network model using the training data. It iterates over batches of images and labels, computes the loss, and updates the model parameters using the Adagrad optimizer.
Evaluating: Evaluates the trained model's performance on the validation set by computing accuracy and generating a confusion matrix. It also visualizes a sample of images with their actual and predicted labels.

## Output and Evaluation :

The accuracy of 97%  shows that the model functioned with high accuracy of correct predictions.
